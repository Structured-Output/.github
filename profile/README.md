# Structured Output

1. Many datasets are expensive, and have strict licensing requirements.
2. This makes the data hard to share, access, and commercialize.
3. Similar datasets can be constructed cheaply using LLM's structured outputs.
4. We release the code and prompts under the MIT License. Go nuts.

## Ideal Use Cases
### The Professor
You are a professor with access to a dataset, but the licensing means that you can't share it with your master's students.

## The Grad Student
You want to do a research project, but the dataset would cost you $50k. 

## The Startup
You want to build an MVP, but can't commercialize due to data licensing.
